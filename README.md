# bob-ross
Shiny app for filtering Bob Ross episodes based on their components
based on the work of
[fivethirtyeight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-statistical-analysis-of-the-work-of-bob-ross/)
journalist [Walt Hickey](https://twitter.com/WaltHickey). Data is
taken from the fivethirtyeight github [data
repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data) with the only
change being an additional column for a link to the corresponding
video on YouTube.
